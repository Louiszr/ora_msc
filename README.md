# ora_msc
My MSc project on Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)

## Usage
Functions are defined in **ora_msc.py**

Scripts for analysis are in the **./scripts/** folder

Put ora_msc.py and Python scripts in the same folder before use (Trying to fix this!)

locality.py does not work at the moment...

## Future fixes
* locality.py
* scripts folder
* data from Zamboni paper, can I put them here?

### 11/07/2017
* fixed a bug which may cause the DE metabolite list a bit longer
* the bug was caused by my ignorance of metabolites which were in the Zamboni background but not in the KEGG database
* old results were therefore a bit less significant than they should be
