# ora_msc
My MSc project on Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)

## Usage
Functions are defined in **ora_msc.py**

Scripts for analysis are in the **./scripts/** folder

Put ora_msc.py and Python scripts in the same folder before use (Trying to fix this!)

locality.py does not work at the moment...

## Future fixes
* locality.py
* scripts folder
* data from Zamboni paper, can I put them here?
